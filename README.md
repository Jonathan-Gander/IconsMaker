# IconsMaker

Are you like me? You can develop great apps but you're not able to use design tools to create nice icons! SwiftUI is so great to create shapes. So why not create your icon with SwiftUI code and have an app to generate all PNG images directly in all different sizes? That's what `IconsMaker` does!

I build it because I needed. And I'm sure it will be usefull for many of you guys!

## Usage

Simply `git clone` or download my project. Open it with Xcode.
